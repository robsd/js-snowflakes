# js-snowflakes ❄️

A JavaScript wrapper for [PavelTheCoder](https://github.com/pajasevi)'s [CSSnowflakes](https://github.com/pajasevi/CSSnowflakes) to activate on demand and control the amount.

## How to use

1. Import the **css/style.css** and **js/script.js**.

2. Call the `snowstorm(X);` function in your own script or assign it to a button with `onclick="snowstorm(X);"` replacing X with how many snowflakes you want.

**Note**: There are 2 styles of snowflake used for each iteration `❅` and `❆`.

## Bonus tip

Combine it with my [countdown script](https://github.com/robsd/js-countdown) and have it snow (virtually) on the 25th!

See my [christmas countdown](https://github.com/robsd/js-christmas-countdown) or [advent calendar](https://github.com/robsd/js-advent-calendar) scripts for an example.
